This section provides the reader with an overview of the Smart Cart. The primary operational aspects of the product, from the perspective of end users, maintainers and administrators, are defined here. The key features and functions found in the product, as well as critical user interactions and user interfaces are described in detail.

\subsection{Features \& Functions}
The main function of the Smart Cart is to help its user carry tools from one point to another. It will also have an integrated power supply to allow its user to charge or power his or her tools. A unique feature of the Smart Cart is that the cart will identify and follow its "master" by using the Intel RealSense. Another unique feature of the cart is its holonomic wheels. This allows the cart to easily maneuver and avoid collisions with objects by using image processing from a camera. 

\subsection{External Inputs \& Outputs}
The Smart Cart will require external input from the user. The user must wear a colored band that is provided with the Smart Cart. This band is used by the cart for tracking its "master". External outputs produced by the cart will be messages to let its user know whether it has succesfully identified its master. There are no other external inputs or outputs.

\subsection{Product Interfaces}
A simple user interface may be implemented for identification of master depending on the availability of time.
