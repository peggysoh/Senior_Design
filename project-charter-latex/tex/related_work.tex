In the past decade, research and development on autonomous carriers have become very popular and high in demand. Most of its applications are used in large manufacturing warehouses to move large, heavy objects, while other applications are to improve quality of life by providing assistance. Today, there are many autonomous robots and carriers available as open-source as well as commercial products. Some organizations even hold competitions for building such robots. The following are some robots that are closely related to our work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Whole Foods has a motorized grocery cart prototype. The grocery cart follows customers around the store and tracks their shopping lists \cite{Welch}. 
	\item AGVSystems has automatic guided carts for material transportation and assembly line tasks. They follow a tape guided path \cite{AGC}.
	\item The Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition is an annual robotics competition where students design and build autonomous ground vehicles that overcome several challenges \cite{IGVC}.
