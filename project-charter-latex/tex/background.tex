Autonomous robots that are able to do hard manual labor are increasing in demand as they are able to outperform a human. Not only do they not tire, they can carry much heavier loads than a human. The Smart Cart is aimed at educators primarily to help them transport their teaching materials from one location to another. Some may wonder why there is a need for an autonomous cart if they can just push the cart itself. The purpose of the cart is not only allow educators to carry more equipment with little or no effort, the cart will also provide an integrated power supply. This allows the educators to be prepared for classes and demonstrations by keeping their equipment charged. Educators can also bring the cart out and provide demonstrations outside where there are often no outlets nearby. Such scenarios will be ideal for outreach programs.
