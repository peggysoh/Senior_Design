Our vision is to create the platform for an autonomous cart to assist educators by helping to transport and power various items from one place to another. The Smart Cart shall help ease the burden of having to make multiple trips and allow educators to use their time more efficiently. The cart shall also help ensure quality delivery of materials and serve to be part of the University of Texas at Arlingtonâ€™s outreach program.
