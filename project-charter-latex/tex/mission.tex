The mission of our project is to work as a team to design and develop a Smart Cart that will provide assistance by being an autonomous carrier. The cart needs to be able to do the following things: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Follow a "master" to the designated destination
	\item Avoid collision with obstacles such as walls and other people
	\item Include an integrated power supply
	\item Holonomic mobility
\end{itemize}

The following list is how we will approach the project to achieve the items mentioned above:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Research on algorithms of how the cart will follow the "master" (lasers, colors or heat signature)
	\item Research the hardware modules (Omni wheels, motors, Intel RealSense, Kinect, Sonar, Stepper)
	\item Research on using Python or C++ and openCV for processing images if needed
	\item Use Google Drive, GitHub and LaTeX for documentation and collaboration
	\item Use GroupMe for team communication
\end{itemize}
