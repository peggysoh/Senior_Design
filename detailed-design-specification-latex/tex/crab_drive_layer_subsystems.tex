The crab drive layer is a vital layer to this project. It's major function shall be to make Smart Cart mobile. It comprises comprises such vital elements as the micro-controller, the motor-controllers and the drive system interface.
\subsection{MOTOR CONTROL SUBSYSTEM}
The motor control subsystem will contain a roller chain that will be responsible for steering the the cart and maintain a consistent orientation for all the wheels, a central motor to coordinate the movement of the four wheels and wheel motors to drive the wheels
