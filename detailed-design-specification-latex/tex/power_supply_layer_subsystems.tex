The power supply layer is one of the most important layers because it provides stable power supply
to the cart. The parts in this subsystem are responsible for powering every other subsystem and any
external tools or equipment.

\subsection{DEEP CYCLE BATTERY}
A rechargeable battery that will provide consistent power up to 12 V.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{ASSUMPTIONS}
\begin{itemize}
\item The battery is charged.
\item The battery is properly connected to the cart
\item The battery is fully functional
\item The battery is connected to the cart at all times
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{RESPONSIBILITIES}
The deep cycle battery subsystem responsibilities are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide stable power supply to the other subsystems after being converted from 12v to 5v by the voltage converter.
\item Enable stable power to external tools and equipment after being converted from 12V to 2 - 3V through the voltage regulator.
\end{itemize}
