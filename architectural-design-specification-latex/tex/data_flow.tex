This section breaks down the simple architectural layer diagram with another level of detail. The logical subsystems that compose each layer and its interactions and interfaces between the subsystems are graphically represented. Even though the power supply layer does not have data flow, it is still a key layer to the system. The following data flow block diagram shows a high level diagram of all the layers in the Smart Cart.
