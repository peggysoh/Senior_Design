The crab drive layer consists of the hardware components that include a main drive motor that is responsible for steering the wheel motors that move the wheels. The drive system interface is responsible for communicating with the camera interface in the imaging subsystem, supplying directions to the main motor, and providing the cart with holonomic capabilities.

\subsection{Drive System Interface Subsystem}
The drive system interface is designed to communicate with the navigation subsystem's camera interface. it will get  navigation data from the camera interface to steer the main drive motor as well as receiving feedback information for the wheel orientations.

\subsection{Wheel Motors Subsystem}
The wheel motors is designed to drive the wheels at an appropriate speedt to follow the user using information sent by the main motor.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Assumptions made are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The wheel motors will be able to decide how fast to spin to achieve an appropriate speed.
	\item The wheel motors will only spin in one direction as the chain/belt system will control steering.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
The wheel motors subsystem's responbilities are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Drive the wheels to follow a user at an appropriate speed.
